# Raga Bhairavi Pattern Identification
Pattern identification - Build a methodology that is able to identify repeated instances of melodic patterns. Students will characterize the difference in performance of these annotated melodic patterns and develop a process that can identify them from audio.

## Overview
TODO: 
This notebook, `final_notebook_nns.ipynb`, provides a comprehensive analysis and comparison of a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) model against random predictions. The main objective is to demonstrate that the GBC model has learned to classify data better than random chance. The notebook includes data preparation, model training, evaluation, and comparison steps.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12.2 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - TODO: falta algun...

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Setting Up the Environment
#### Clone or Download the Repository:
Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

#### Navigate to the Directory:
Change to the directory where the notebook is located.
```bash
cd <repository_directory>
```

#### Start Jupyter Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab in the directory.
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

#### Open the Notebook:
In the Jupyter interface, open final_notebook_nns.ipynb.


## Notebook Structure

#### 3. Model Training, Prediction and Evaluation:
TODO: Explicar que se hace en esta sección (+ explicar random predictions)


## Running the Notebook
To execute the notebook, follow these steps:

#### 1. Run All Cells:
You can run all cells sequentially by selecting Cell > Run All from the Jupyter menu.

#### 2. Step-by-Step Execution:
Alternatively, you can execute the cells one by one. This allows you to understand the code and outputs at each stage.

#### 3. Check for Dependencies:
Ensure all libraries are installed. If you encounter errors, check if all dependencies are satisfied.

#### 4. Modify Parameters (Optional):
If you wish to experiment, modify the parameters or try with different datasets.


## Understanding the Output
TODO: Intro
#### Data Exploration:
TODO: Visual and statistical summaries to understand data distribution and characteristics.

#### Model Performance:
TODO: Accuracy scores and classification reports to evaluate model performance.

#### Random Baseline:
TODO: Performance metrics for random predictions to provide a baseline for comparison.

#### Comparison Analysis:
TODO: Side-by-side comparison of the GBC and random predictions. The analysis should show that the GBC performs better than random chance, indicating it has learned meaningful patterns in the data.
